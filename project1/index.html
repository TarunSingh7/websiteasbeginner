            He heroically fought for India's independence as a socialist
            revolutionary. Born to a Sikh family in the Punjabi town of Banga in
            September 1907, his mother was Vidyavati and his father was Kishan
            Singh. Some of his family members served in Maharaja Ranjit Singh's
            army, while others were prominent members of the Indian Independence
            Movement. He was a strong supporter of the Swadeshi Movement. Bhagat
            Singhs’s belief in nonviolence faded with time and believed that
            only armed rebellion could bring independence. He joined the
            struggle for freedom at a very young age.
